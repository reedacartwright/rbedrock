## Overview

rbedrock is an extension package for [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
that supports the analysis and management of Minecraft (Bedrock Edition)
worlds. This includes Windows 10, Pocket Edition, XBox, and PS4 versions
of the game. It does not include Minecraft: Java worlds.

If you are not already using R, you will need to install the latest
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and optionally
[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).

## Installation

``` r
# The easiest way to install rbedrock is from CRAN.
install.packages("rbedrock")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("reedacartwright/rbedrock")

# Install tidyverse (not needed, but useful)
# install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If you are not on Windows or Mac, this will install rbedrock from
source, and you will need to have suitable development tools installed
on your machine. This includes [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).
